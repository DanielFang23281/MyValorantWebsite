            <h1>2021 Masters Reykjavík</h1>
            <p>At VCT 2021 Stage 2 Masters in Reykjavík, Sentinels delivered a dominant performance against Fnatic in the grand finals, sweeping them 3-0 in a best-of-five series. From the outset, Sentinels showcased flawless coordination, mechanical prowess, and superior map control, led by their star player TenZ, who was unstoppable throughout the series. Every round felt like a statement, with Sentinels dictating the pace and shutting down Fnatic's strategies before they could develop. Their aggressive yet calculated playstyle overwhelmed Fnatic, who struggled to find openings or momentum. The win not only secured Sentinels the title of the first international Valorant champions but also solidified their reputation as the most dominant team in the world at the time.</p>

                <p>In the grand final of VCT 2024 Masters Madrid, Sentinels delivered an unforgettable comeback against Gen.G Esports, winning the series 3-2. Despite falling behind early with back-to-back losses on Breeze and Ascent, Sentinels refused to fold. They clawed their way back into the series with a gritty 14-12 win on Bind, followed by a solid 13-10 showing on Split. By the time the final map Icebox rolled around, Sentinels were fully in control. They crushed Gen.G 13-6, with zekken leading the charge and tying the record for most kills in a best-of-five with 101. Sentinels showcased elite mental resilience, razor-sharp aim, and smart mid-series adjustments that completely shut down Gen.G's momentum. The win crowned Sentinels as Masters Madrid champions and reasserted their dominance on the global Valorant stage.</p>

                <h1>2025 Champions </h1>
                <p>If Sentinels hit their stride at the right moment, they have all the tools to dominate their bracket. With a strong map pool and a roster featuring clutch-capable players like Zekken and N4RRATE, they can set the pace from the opening rounds. On defense they tighten rotations and minimize first-kills; on attack they execute layered utility plays that wear down opponents. By taking early momentum and converting it into clean map wins, they avoid the danger of letting bracket pressure mount. If they win their first match and force the loser's bracket from the get-go, this gives them both breathing room and confidence. From there, with disciplined vetoes and smart adaptations (especially after halftime), they march through the bracket with minimal losses, secure that upper-bracket seed, and arrive in the playoffs with both momentum and control.</p>
